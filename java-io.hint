ldesc: "This provides a few much needed extensions to the Java I/O 
subsystem. Firstly, there is a class which will connect and InputStream 
with an OutputStream and copy data between them.  Secondly there are two 
classes for inserting into an Input or OutputStream pipe a command line 
command. Thirdly there are a pair of classes for splitting streams in 
two."
